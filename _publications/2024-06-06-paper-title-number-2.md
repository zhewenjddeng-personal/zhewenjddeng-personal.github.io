excerpt: 'The authors designed a hole-transfer material with a phosphonic acid group bonding to indium-tin oxide and a nitrogen atom in the aromatic carbazole group bonded with lead in the perovskite. A champion perovskite minimodule retained a power conversion efficiency of more than 16% after 29 weeks of outdoor testing.'

The authors designed a hole-transfer material with a phosphonic acid group bonding to indium-tin oxide and a nitrogen atom in the aromatic carbazole group bonded with lead in the perovskite. A champion perovskite minimodule retained a power conversion efficiency of more than 16% after 29 weeks of outdoor testing.
