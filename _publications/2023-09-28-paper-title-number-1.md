excerpt: 'Ammonium cations with a high acid dissociation constant (pKa), including PEAMA+ (pKa = 12.0) and BAMA+ (pKa = 12.0), can replace PEA+ or BA+ for passivation and are stable with FA-based perovskites due to their resistance to further deprotonation. P–i–n structure solar cells with PEAMA+ additive maintained over 90% of their initial efficiency after light soaking at open circuit and 90 °C for 1,500 hours.'

Ammonium cations with a high acid dissociation constant (pKa), including PEAMA+ (pKa = 12.0) and BAMA+ (pKa = 12.0), can replace PEA+ or BA+ for passivation and are stable with FA-based perovskites due to their resistance to further deprotonation. P–i–n structure solar cells with PEAMA+ additive maintained over 90% of their initial efficiency after light soaking at open circuit and 90 °C for 1,500 hours.
