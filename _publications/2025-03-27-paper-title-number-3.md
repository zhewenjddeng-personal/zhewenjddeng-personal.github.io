excerpt: 'The incorporation of two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper halide perovskite seeds into a FAPbI3 precursor solution was shown to template the growth of and stabilize cubic FAPbI3. We investigate the nanoscale structural and optoelectronic mechanisms behind the observed bulk stabilization using synchrotron-based X-ray microscopies. Nanoprobe X-ray diffraction reveals 2D-templated FAPbI3 films exhibit an average compressive strain normal to the substrate of − 3.3%, 2-fold larger than that of MACl-stabilized FAPbI3.'

The incorporation of two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper halide perovskite seeds into a FAPbI3 precursor solution was shown to template the growth of and stabilize cubic FAPbI3. We investigate the nanoscale structural and optoelectronic mechanisms behind the observed bulk stabilization using synchrotron-based X-ray microscopies. Nanoprobe X-ray diffraction reveals 2D-templated FAPbI3 films exhibit an average compressive strain normal to the substrate of − 3.3%, 2-fold larger than that of MACl-stabilized FAPbI3.
