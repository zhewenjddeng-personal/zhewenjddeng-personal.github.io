title: "Spatiall-resolved Electronic Parameters in Silicon Solar cells"
excerpt: "This system generates spatially resolved images of series resistance (Rs), dark saturation currents (I₀₁, I₀₂), and other electronic parameters consists of an IV curve, excluding shunts. Reproduced from Chao Shen *et al.*, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells (2014), using in-house–built hardware and software."
