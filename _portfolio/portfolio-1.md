title: "Reverse Leakage Current Tracking System"
excerpt: "ISOS-V3 Reverse Leakage Current Trackers tracks the leakage current of a solar cell or module when subject to negative open circuit voltage bias under 85% relative humidity and at 85C in the dark. The setup replace the needs of expansive 4-quadrant source measuring units (~$6000+ per module) with low-cost power supplies ($70 per module) and current tracking modules ($25 per module), expanding the test capacity at a much affordable price. The system is built to accept 7 device under tests, but can add additional low-cost testing slots if needed by the users. A graphical user interface with on and off control and tracked current display is included in additional to the hardwares. "
