<p>
  Hi! My name is <b>Zhewen JD Deng (邓喆雯)</b>. I go by <b>JD</b>. 
</p>

<p>
  I am a fifth year PhD in Chemical Engineering at UC San Diego (expected June 2026), advised by <a href="https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/node/3546" target="_blank">Dr. David Fenning</a>. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2020.
</p>

<p>
  My research is on advanced photovoltaics luminescence imaging and instrumentation/automation. I develop automated characterization platforms and novel scientific methods to accelerate materials research. My work specifically applies to **energy, semiconductor, and optical materials**, with chemical engineering fundamentals. I'm proficient in both Python and MATLAB for hardware control and data analysis. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>I am currently seeking Full-Time R&D, Process, Product or Automation/Instrumentation Engineering roles starting Summer 2026. I am also open to advanced internships.</b>
