Hi! My name is **Zhewen JD Deng (邓喆雯)**. I go by **JD**. 

I am a fifth year PhD in Chemical Engineering at UC San Diego (expected 2026), advised by [Dr. David Fenning](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/node/3546). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2020.

My research is on advanced photovoltaics luminescence imaging and instrumentation/automation. I am driven by building tools that combine hardware and software control with chemical engineering fundamentals. My work specifically applies these automated platforms to the study of **energy, semiconductor, and optical materials**. I specialize in developing automated characterization platforms and novel scientific methods to accelerate materials research. I'm proficient in both Python and MATLAB for hardware control and data analysis. 

**I am currently seeking Full-Time R&D, Process, or Automation/Instrumentation Engineering roles starting in Summer 2026. I am also open to advanced internships.**
