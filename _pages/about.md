Hi! My name is **Zhewen JD Deng (邓喆雯)**. I go by **JD**. 

I am a fifth year PhD in Chemical Engineering at UC San Diego (expected June 2026), advised by [Dr. David Fenning](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/node/3546). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2020.

My research is on advanced photovoltaics luminescence imaging and instrumentation/automation. I develop automated characterization platforms and novel scientific methods to accelerate materials research. My work specifically applies to **energy, semiconductor, and optical materials**, with chemical engineering fundamentals. I'm proficient in both Python and MATLAB for hardware control and data analysis. 

**I am currently seeking Full-Time R&D, Process, or Automation/Instrumentation Engineering roles starting Summer 2026. I am also open to advanced internships.**
